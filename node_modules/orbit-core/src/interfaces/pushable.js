  /**
   Mixes the `Pushable` interface into a source.

   The `Pushable` interface adds a single method to a Source: `push`. This
   method accepts a `Transform` instance as an argument and returns a promise
   that resolves to an array of `Transform` instances that are applied as a
   result. In other words, `push` captures the direct and side effects of
   applying a `Transform` to a source.

   This interface is part of the "request flow" in Orbit. Requests trigger
   events before and after processing of each request. Observers can delay the
   resolution of a request by returning a promise in an event listener.

   The `Pushable` interface introduces the following events:

   * `beforePush` - emitted prior to the processing of `push`, this event
     includes the requested `Transform` as an argument.

   * `push` - emitted after a `push` has successfully been applied, this
     event's arguments include both the requested `Transform` and an array of
     the actual applied `Transform` instances.

   * `pushFail` - emitted when an error has occurred pushing a transform, this
     event's arguments include both the requested `Transform` and the error.

   A `Pushable` source must implement a private method `_push`, which performs
   the processing required for `push` and returns a promise that resolves to an
   array of `Transform` instances.
