  /**
   Mixes the `Queryable` interface into a source.

   The `Queryable` interface adds a single method to a source: `query`. This
   method accepts a `Query` instance or query expression which it then converts
   to a `Query` instance. The source evaluates the query and returns a promise
   that resolves to a static set of results.

   This interface is part of the "request flow" in Orbit. Requests trigger events
   before and after processing of each request. Observers can delay the
   resolution of a request by returning a promise in an event listener.

   The `Queryable` interface introduces the following events:

   * `beforeQuery` - emitted prior to the processing of `query`, this event
     includes the requested `Query` as an argument.

   * `query` - emitted after a `query` has successfully returned, this
     event's arguments include both the requested `Query` and the results.

   * `queryFail` - emitted when an error has occurred processing a query, this
     event's arguments include both the requested `Query` and the error.

   A `Queryable` source must implement a private method `_query`, which performs
   the processing required for `query` and returns a promise that resolves to a
   set of results.
